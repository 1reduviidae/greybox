This map contains three bitcoin miners that compete against each other
to build a completely new block chain, al the way from the origin block.

The bitcoin software being used is expected to have the cpu-based miner
feature re-inserted (it has been removed from upstream), and also to be
able to reach out and connect to peers (starting with a built-in seed
list) when operating in 'regtest' mode.
