The btc-demo.imn map contains three bitcoin miners that compete against
each other to build a completely new block chain, al the way from the
origin block.

The bitcoin software being used is expected to have the cpu-based miner
feature re-inserted (it has been removed from upstream), and also to be
able to reach out and connect to peers (starting with a built-in seed
list) when operating in 'regtest' mode.


The dhcp-demo.imn map contains a full bitcoin+tor simulation as described
above (for btc-demo.imn), with the addition of four geographically diverse
ingress points, all of which serve DHCP to any client machine connected at
the Ethernet layer. The greybox machine is expected to have four Ethernet
interfaces (or VLan sub-interfaces), each of which must be mapped to one
of the four RJ45 nodes in the map (replace each of 'eth[XYZW]' with the
appropriate (sub-)interface available on the greybox VM, either by editing
the (ASCII) dhcp-demo.imn file, or by configuring the RJ45 nodes via the
CORE GUI).
